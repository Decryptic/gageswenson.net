    <h1>Turbulence</h1>
    <h2>19 October 2024</h2>
    <p>Lately I've been caught up in some hoopla that's held me up quite a bit. I wont get too far into the weeds. There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel. I should be resuming school at UH Manoa this coming Spring 2025 semester. Also, I've been able to jump through all the legal landmines God had laid in path the past several years. Finally, I overcame copious hurdles which led to tremendous personal development. Now, I must simply maintain. <a href="/contact">Reach out to me</a> for more details, or stay tuned for further developments. Mahalo 'ohana. Aloha maluhia hele.</p>
