    <h1>Baccarat Dealer</h1>
    <h2>19 July 2022</h2>
    <p>I first started writing code around 2010. I (foolishly) thought I had a good grasp on C# and wanted to write code in C++. I thought the only real difference was that C# accessed things with a dot, and C++ accessed object properties with an arrow. So I tried to write a blackjack game in C++. When memory leaks innevitably occured, I abandoned the project altogether.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, I'm a student at UH Hilo, and our professor gives us an assignment to write any simulation, in any language we choose. I thought it would be impressive to code my project in C++, and I was interested in learning about the casino card game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccarat">Baccarat</a>. So, I created <a href="https://github.com/Decryptic/BaccaratSimulator">this Baccarat simulator</a>.</p>
    <p>It dawned on me that I am able to tackle this programming assignment that I had failed to create over a decade ago. With the magic of <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> UIs, I created <a href="/apps/card_counting_companion">Card Counting Companion</a>, a free &amp; open-source app on the Play &amp; App Stores. This is exactly the app I had wanted to create over a decade ago, but I had lacked the expertise.</p>
    <p>Now I have all of this source code for animating playing cards in Flutter, and with it, I created another card game, <a href="/apps/baccarat_dealer">Baccarat Dealer</a>. Baccarat Dealer is very similar to the Baccarat Simulator that I wrote, except it's animated.</p>
    <p>It costs $1 on the Play &amp; App Stores, and I haven't published the source code on GitHub. Anyone who is motivated enough could probably put together a better rendition by logically merging the working components of Card Counting Companion and Baccarat Simulator.</p>
    <p>Much to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>'s dismay, I decided to sell the app, rather than make it free, because I figured anybody who needs an app like this is running a table or testing a strategy, with the intent to make money. Also, I have 3 apps on the App Stores already (Date Countdown, Fibs and Primes, Card Counting Companion). They are attracting lots of downloads on the App Store, but rather stagnant on the Play Store. I wanted to see how a paid app would fare, in comparison.</p>
    <p>Presently, <a href="/apps/baccarat_dealer">Baccarat Dealer</a> has by far the most impressions (views) on the App Store, but also the fewest downloads, since the free promotion I was running ended on Wednesday (July 13th) last week. During the promotion, 40 people downloaded it. Since, only 2 people have bought it.</p>
    <p>On the Play Store, the app got 3 downloads during the free promotion, and one person has since paid for it. I will be curious to see how it does moving forward. I usually don't pay for any apps, but I occasionally will shell out $1 for apps I really want. In the future maybe I will try crafting some apps with in-app purchases.</p>
